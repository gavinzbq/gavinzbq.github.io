                <p>The website is generated by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a>. In short, it is a static site generator written in Python. I will provide a few tips a list of useful materials. Since it is merely three weeks since I have been using it, you will not see a comprehensive review, nor a step-by-step tutorial for there have already been plenty of good ones. I recommend <a class="reference external" href="http://nafiulis.me/making-a-static-blog-with-pelican.html">Making a Static Blog with Pelican</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="prerequisite">
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Python.</p>
<p>A little bit experience is required, but do not start learning the language
from here. The more fluent you are, more hackable the framework would be.
FYI you may learn Python basics from  <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/">Google's Python Class</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>
<p>It is useful to learn about Internet, World Wide Web. HTML is the webpages'
content, and CSS is in charge of styling.
Good learning lessons can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="http://marksheet.io/">MarkSheet</a>.
My favorite MarkSheet's feature is each tutorial lasts no longer than ten
minutes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A healthy mindset</p>
<p>Open source softwares are not easy to use. The beauty of open source is not
only that they are free, but to find we are not alone. And this never ending learning and communicating process is very
rewarding in the long run. Programming can be tedious, we should use it as a tool to avoid more
tedious everyday tasks for later on. Practice <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="things-i-want-to-stress-and-hurdles-i-encountered">
<h2>Things I want to stress and hurdles I encountered</h2>
<p>Most frustration comes from manipulating the theme. I have no better
advice other than do spend some time conducting experiment with HTML template
files and CSS files.</p>
<p>If you would like to host articles with different topics, just assign
&quot;category&quot; metadata to them. For example, articles under &quot;Blogs&quot;
navigation bar have category of &quot;Blog&quot;, and those under &quot;Gallery&quot; belong to
&quot;Gallery&quot; category.</p>
<p>I found <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/photos">&quot;photos&quot;</a> very handy to process images. &quot;photos&quot; is a powerful plugin if you want to post
bunches of photos like I did, it can resize images / generate thumbnails /
embed images and even whole gallery in articles. The documentation is very
helpful.</p>
<p>&quot;photos&quot; plugin would be perfect if it could generate thumbnails according to
the exact size I specified. For the matter of style and taste, square
thumbnails are more desirable yet &quot;photos&quot; can only provide those whose aspect
ratio align with their original images. Therefore I turned to another plugin
specialize in processing thumbnails named <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/thumbnailer">&quot;thumbnailer&quot;</a>.
I would like to add this feature to &quot;photos&quot; if I have time.</p>
<p>In general, I found Pelican, its associated themes and plugins are fairly
customizable. Bear in mind that diving in the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html">official documentation</a> never
hurts, especially when Google answers are exhausted.</p>
<p>Enjoy hacking.</p>

<div class="section" id="updated-on-05-29-2017">
<h2>Updated on 05/29/2017</h2>
<p>I have no idea what <a class="reference external" href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">responsive web design</a> means at first, and was shocked by how ugly it is when opened on a mobile.</p>
<p>The bad news is I did not choose to use a mobile-first / responsive front-end framework like <a class="reference external" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. The good news is I do not have to as long as I make acquaintance with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp">media queries</a>. In my case, what I did is just changing font size and image size. It now looks much more decent on smaller devices.</p>

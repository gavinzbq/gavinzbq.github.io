                <p>The website is generated by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a>.
It is a static site generator written in Python. I will describe the building process briefly, and will make a list of useful
materials I refered to. Since I have been playing with it for merely three weeks, you will not see
a comprehensive review here. And you will not see a step-by-step tutorial
either because there have already been many good ones. I recommend <a class="reference external" href="http://nafiulis.me/making-a-static-blog-with-pelican.html">Making a Static Blog with Pelican</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="prerequisite">
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Python.
A little bit experience is required, but do not start learning the language
from here. The more fluent you are, more hackable the framework would be.
I myself started learning Python from:
* <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/">Google's Python Class</a>.</li>
<li>HTML, CSS and JavaScript
It is useful to learn about Internet, World Wide Web. HTML is the webpages'
conttent, and CSS is in charge of styling.
Good learning lessons can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="http://marksheet.io/">MarkSheet</a>.
My favorite MarkSheet's feature is each tutorial lasts no longer than ten
minutes.</li>
<li>A healthy mindset
Open source softwares are not easy to use. The beauty of open source is not
only that they are free, but we will find we are not the only person
using it. And this never ending learning and communicating process is very
rewarding. Programming can be tedious, we should use it as a tool to avoid more
tedious everyday tasks for later on.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="things-i-want-to-stress-and-hurdles-i-encountered">
<h2>Things I want to stress and hurdles I encountered</h2>
<p>Most parts of frustration comes from manipulating the theme. I have no better
advice other than do spend some time conducting experiment with HTML template
files and CSS files.</p>
<p>If you would like to host articles with different topics, just assign
&quot;category&quot; metadata to them. For example, articles under &quot;Blogs&quot;
navigation bar have category of &quot;Blog&quot;, and those under &quot;Gallery&quot; belong to
&quot;Gallery&quot; category.</p>
<p>I found <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/photos">photos</a> very handy to process images. &quot;Photos&quot; is a powerful plugin if you want to post
bunches of photos like I did, it can resize images / generate thumbnails /
embed images and even whole gallery in articles. The documentation is very
helpful.</p>
<p>&quot;photos&quot; plugin would be perfect if it could generate thumbnails according to
the exact size I specified. For the matter of style and taste, square
thumbnails are more desirable yet &quot;photos&quot; can only provide those whose aspect
ratio inherits from their original images. Therefore I turned to another plugin
specialize in processing thumbnails named <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/thumbnailer">thumbnailer</a>.
I would like to add this feature to &quot;photos&quot; if I have time.</p>
<p>In general, I found Pelican, its associated themes and plugins are fairly
customizable. Bear in mind that diving in the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html">official documentation</a> never
hurts, especially when Google answers are exhausted.</p>
<p>Enjoy hacking.</p>

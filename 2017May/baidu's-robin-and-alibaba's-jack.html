                <p>It baffled me when people introduce themselves as &quot;call me Tom /
Jerry / Max&quot; given they come from the same culture as mine. I especially
dispised those who, work in foreign company based in China, and let other
people call their English nicknames. &quot;What a shame they lose pride in
our culture and worship western countires for no reason.&quot;, I said to
myself.</p>
<p>I became a little bit rational lately.</p>
<p>We do not just learn the language when learning English, we learn the way
English speakers think, react and communicate -- the culture behind the
language. In such a context, addressing other people by given names is
everyday life, no matter they are younger / older / peers, your relatives
or not, share one academic advisor with you or not, your co-workers or boss. It
is not required or even not expected to call people by their positions.
The purpose, of course, is that a lack of hierarchy will encourage the idea
that all livings being treated equally. It is one of the most important values
America is founded.</p>
<p>Coming back to the foreign companies and tech companies in China, using
English names indicate workers switch to a different cultural mind-set. CEOs
express respect to their engineers by demonstrating you are working in a
horizontal structure and not a hierarchical one, therefore feel free to follow
and share your own ideas among us.</p>
<p>For now I do not use a English name and I give my last name when order a
Starbuck. I love my given name and I think my parents
are brilliant.</p>
<p>Bear in mind my English speaker friends, people from different
nations allow you call their English names because they are nice and they
want to make your life easier.</p>
